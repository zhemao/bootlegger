Version 1.0.4

Make sure the md5 sum of the plaintext file is passed to the server.

Version 1.0.3

Made the python api object-oriented to reduce the number of arguments that
need to be passed to the api functions.

Version 0.5.1

Verify the signature set by the server in the cookie. This is sort of a 
chicken-egg problem, because the server's public key must itself be downloaded
from the server. Thus this probably wouldn't be that effective against MITM
attacks. I will have to research better ways of doing this. 

Version 0.5.0

Change to a chunked AES encryption scheme, in which file is encrypted in blocks
of at most 2^15 bytes at a time. This avoids having to read the entire file 
into memory before encrypting it, allowing for fast encryption of large files.

Version 0.4.0

Add support for listing older versions of a file and deleting a file. 
Note: deletion is non-reversible. All previous versions of the file will be
deleted.
