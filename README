Bootlegger: Command Line Interface for Speakeasy
================================================

Bootlegger is the command line interface for speakeasy, the paranoid file 
storage solution.

Installation:
	
	pip install bootlegger

or clone the repo and run 

	python setup.py install

Configuration:

Create a folder in your home directory called .bootlegger.
In this folder, generate private and public RSA keys called user_private.pem 
and user_public.pem, respectively. This can be accomplished using openssl.

	cd ~/.bootlegger
	openssl genrsa -out user_private.pem 2048
	# add -des3 if you want a passphrase
	openssl rsa -pubout -in user_private.pem -out user_public.pem

Create a file in the .bootlegger folder called bootlegger.conf. Add the 
following information

	[speakeasy]
	host = www.example.com
	username = testuser

Replace the values with your desired host and username.

Usage:

To add your public key to the server, run

	bl addkey 

To upload a file, run

	bl upload file.txt

You can give this subcommand multiple arguments

	bl upload file1.txt file2.txt ...

Giving the prefix option prefixes each filename on the server

	bl upload file.txt -p xyz # uploads to xyz_file.txt

To list all the files you have stored on the server, run

	bl list

You can optionally give the list command a Unix typeglob as a parameter to
list only files that match the pattern. Make sure to properly escape to the
glob so that your shell doesn't expand it.

	bl list \*.txt

To download a file run

	bl download file.txt

If the file is prefixed, run

	bl download file.txt -p xyz # downloads xyz_file.txt to file.txt

To download into a directory other than the current working directory run
	
	bl download file.txt -d some/other/directory

To get detailed information about a file, run

	bl info file.txt

To share a file with another user, run

	bl share otheruser file.txt

You can override the username and host in the configuration file by passing
arguments to the --username and --host options on the command line.
